# **diet-ect**
HTML template engine plugin for diet based on [ECT][1]. The Fastest JavaScript template engine with embedded CoffeeScript syntax.

## **Learn about ECT**:
Learn how to use it at the engine's website and github page:

- **Website:** http://ectjs.com/
- **Github:** https://github.com/baryshev/ect

## **Install**
```
npm install diet-ect
```

## **Example Usage**

**/your_app/index.js**
```js
// Require Diet
require('diet');

// Create App
var app = new App();

// Configure Domain
app.domain('http://localhost:8000/');

// Plugin ECT
app.plugin('diet-ect', { alias: 'html' }) // alias is recommended

// Start HTTP Server
app.start();

// Listen on GET /
// ECT is a global plugin so you'll have access to it from every route
// We can call it with `$.html()` as we are using the `alias` config
app.get('/', function($){
   // Set a template variable
   $.data.engine = 'The Wonderful ECT.js';
   
   // Now serve the html file 
   // by default: /your_app/static/index.html 
   // use the `root` config to change this
   $.html(); 
});
```
**/your_app/static/index.html**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello World!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World with {{-this.engine}}</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

## **Template Variables**
You can access **anything defined in the `$` signal** from your templates:

```js
$.query 	// in template {{ this.query }}
$.body 		// in template {{ this.body }}
$.params 	// in template {{ this.params }}
$.url 		// in template {{ this.query}}
$.data 		// in template {{ this }} data is a special variable
```

## **The $.data variable**
- The `$.data` object has a priority and will overwrite the variables from the signal. 
- The `$.data` variable is directly accessible like `{{-this.myVar}}` instead of `{{-this.data.myVar}}`.
- The `$.data` object is also used by the `$.json()` response making APIs easier to build.

## **Custom file**
By default `$.html()` will serve an `index.html` file relativ to the `root` config. 
```js
$.html('yourFile.html'); // will serve /your_app/static/yourFile.html
```
You can change the file when you call `$.html()` by passing in an argument with a different path.

## **Config**
You can use any config that [ECT][2] already has. These are the defaults with `diet-ect`:

```js
app.plugin('diet-ect', {
	root : $.path+'/static/', 
	ext: '.html', 
	open: '{{', close: '}}',
	cache: true,
	watch: true,
	gzip: true
});
```
It's a good idea to use an `alias` like `html` so the reference in your routes is `$.html()` instead of `$['diet-ect']()`
